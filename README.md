## Bidding Website 
---
A website where users can view and bid on products that they are looking for that are being offered by people who own them but no longer needed. The condition of the product could be new and used so that users can be flexible and also to attract more users. Popular products would be displayed on the landing page(after logging in ) with additional functionality allowing the users to search by name or user for the products they need or the seller that they are looking for.

### Sign up and Log-in 

In order to utilise  the service of the app the user must be logged in and in the case of a new user they ust register with a valid email address and a password that is accepted by our password criteria, Guest users with out account would be able to see and view products but unable to bid unless they become registered users. 

---

### Bidding Functionality
The bids will be submitted through deduction of Bid Credits and if the seller doesn't accept the closing bid by the time it expires the credits go back to the user and the user can submit another bid. A buying user can bid on more than one product under  the condition that they have enough bid credits for that specific transaction and they can bid multiple times on a product only if their current bid isn't the highest bid otherwise only one bid is accepted. All bids that aren't accepted by the seller for a time period of 30 days would be deleted and the bet credits returned to the bidding user.

### Product Page 
A swiss style navigation page with all products up for sale in a carousel pattern showing some pictures along with additional information on the product, selecting a product opens a page with product and seller information with an option to either bid for product or buy at seller's desired place. Additionally there is a search bar to search for the specific product that you need the results are arranged according to relevance and popularity.

### Messaging System 
Our customers should be warned by email if their bids were succesfull or not.

---

### Product Messaging System 
Our customers would be able to contact each other via messages in case there is any issue/question and also to encourage negotiations in private to help customer chances of buying the products they want. Messaging would be accessed through products and not profiles this way if it is a question the seller can easily know what is going on and give a suitable reply making the process smoother. Good t ohave.

### New Products for Bidding
Due to time constraints, the products that will be placed for bidding are going to be hard coded into the database.
